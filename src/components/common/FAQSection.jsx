            question: "How do you handle both design and development?",
            answer: "I manage end-to-end project delivery, collaborating with skilled UI/UX designers when needed. While I focus on development, I work closely with trusted freelance designers to ensure a cohesive design-to-development workflow. This allows me to deliver complete solutions while maintaining direct project oversight."

            id: 5,
            question: "Do you work with existing designs or start from scratch?",
            answer: "I'm flexible! Whether you need a design from scratch, have existing designs to implement, or need improvements to current designs, I can help. For new designs, I collaborate with skilled designers while personally handling the implementation."
        },
        {
            id: 6,
            question: "How do you handle feedback and revisions?",
            answer: "I maintain open communication throughout the project and welcome feedback at every stage. Since I personally oversee both design and development, I can efficiently implement revisions and ensure changes are executed exactly as needed."
        },
        {
            id: 7,
            question: "What do you need to get started?",
            answer: "To begin, I need your project requirements, timeline expectations, and any brand guidelines or preferences you have. We'll have an initial consultation to discuss your vision and determine the best approach for your specific needs."
