      id: '01',
      question: 'What AI technologies do you work with?',
      answer: 'I work with a wide range of AI technologies including machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn), natural language processing tools (NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers), computer vision libraries (OpenCV), and cloud-based AI services (AWS AI Services, Google Cloud AI, Azure AI). I also integrate leading language models like GPT, Claude, and open-source alternatives based on project requirements.'
    },
    {
      id: '02',
      question: 'How much data do we need to implement an AI solution?',
      answer: 'The amount of data required depends on the complexity of your AI project. Some applications can work with relatively small, high-quality datasets, while others may require larger volumes of data. We\'ll assess your existing data assets during the discovery phase and develop a data strategy that works with what you have. In some cases, we can leverage pre-trained models or transfer learning approaches to reduce data requirements.'
    },
    {
      id: '03',
      question: 'How long does it take to develop an AI solution?',
      answer: 'Development timelines vary based on the complexity of your project, data availability, and integration requirements. Simple AI implementations might take 4-8 weeks, while more complex, custom solutions can take 3-6 months or longer. During our initial consultation, I\'ll provide a detailed timeline based on your specific requirements and project scope.'
    },
    {
      id: '04',
      question: 'Do we need specialized hardware to run AI applications?',
      answer: 'Not necessarily. Many AI solutions can run efficiently on standard cloud infrastructure or your existing systems. For computationally intensive applications, we might leverage cloud-based services with specialized AI hardware. I design solutions with your infrastructure constraints in mind, optimizing for performance while keeping hardware requirements reasonable.'
    },
    {
      id: '05',
      question: 'How do we measure the ROI of an AI implementation?',
      answer: 'We establish clear KPIs and success metrics at the project outset. Depending on your goals, we might track metrics like time saved through automation, increased accuracy rates, improved customer satisfaction, reduced costs, or revenue growth. I work with you to implement monitoring tools that track these metrics over time, providing clear visibility into your AI investment\'s performance.'
    },
    {
      id: '06',
      question: 'Can you enhance our existing systems with AI rather than building something new?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. I specialize in integrating AI capabilities into existing systems through APIs, microservices, and other integration approaches. This allows you to enhance your current workflows and applications with intelligent features without disrupting your technology stack or requiring a complete rebuild.'
    },
    {
      id: '07',
      question: 'How do you ensure the security and privacy of our data?',
      answer: 'Data security and privacy are paramount in AI development. I implement robust security measures including data encryption, secure access controls, and privacy-preserving techniques. I also ensure compliance with relevant regulations like GDPR or CCPA. All data handling practices are transparent and documented, and I can work within your existing security frameworks.'
